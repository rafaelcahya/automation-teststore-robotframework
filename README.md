## 🤖 Automation Testing with Robot Framework + Automation TestStore
Hey there! 👋 In this repo, I’m showing how I automate testing for an e-commerce site using Robot Framework. I’m using Automation Test Store as my test playground — it’s a great site to practice testing real-world features like login, registration, and managing user info.

All my tests are integrated with Jenkins, so they can run automatically after a commit or on a schedule.

## 🎯 What’s This Repo All About?

I created this project to automate common user actions on Automation Test Store:
1. 🔐 Login – Making sure users can sign in correctly
2. 🆕 Register – Testing new user registration flow
3. ❓ Forgot Password – Verifying the reset password process
4. 🧑‍💻 Forgot Login Name – Testing username recovery
5. 🏠 Add Address – Checking if users can save their shipping address

These are typical real-life actions users perform, so I wanted to make sure they work — every time.

## 🧰 Tools I’m Using
Here’s the tech stack I used to build and run these tests:
1. Robot Framework – My main testing framework, great for readable and modular test cases
2. SeleniumLibrary – To interact with the browser
3. Jenkins – To run the tests automatically in CI/CD
4. Automation Test Store – A publicly accessible test site, perfect for UI and functional automation
